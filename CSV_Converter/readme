//Description about CSV files and their uses

A CSV is a comma separated values file, which allows data to be saved in a table structured format.
CSVs look like a garden-variety spreadsheet but with a .csv extension 
(Traditionally they take the form of a text file containing information separated by commas, hence the name). 
CSV files can be used with any spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, Open Office Calc, or Google Spreadsheets. 
They differ from other spreadsheet file types in that you can only have a single sheet in a file, they can not save cell, 
column, or row styling, and can not save formulas.

Uses:
In e-commerce, CSVs are used primarily for importing and exporting product, customer, and order information to and from your store.
